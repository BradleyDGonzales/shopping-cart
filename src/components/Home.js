                    We are a company of masculinity and brotherhood.
                    From their humble origins as the tools of cavemen to the more modern surgical and cooking knives of today,
                    knives have always symbolized prowess and strength and subsequently, were motifs of masculinity. In
                    literature and other mediums, knives are considered a male symbol because of their phallic nature. We, as a company, strive
                    to forge the best of the best for our brothers in arms, friends, family, and most importantly: YOU. With our shop, you have
                    the freedom to choose the path forward with your new knife/knives. Whether it'd be for survival, showcasing, or collecting, we guarantee
                    that you will be satisfied with your choice.
